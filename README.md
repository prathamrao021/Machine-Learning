Description: This project will give you a brief introduction to the Machine Learning Algorithms. Machine Learning is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on developing algorithms and models that enable computers to learn from and make predictions or decisions based on data. Instead of being explicitly programmed to perform specific tasks, machine learning systems use statistical techniques to learn and improve their performance over time as they are exposed to more data.

Types of Learning:
Supervised Learning: Models are trained on labeled data, where the algorithm learns to map input data to output labels.
Unsupervised Learning: Models find patterns and structure in unlabeled data, clustering or reducing dimensionality.
Reinforcement Learning: Agents learn through interaction with an environment, receiving rewards or penalties based on their actions.

Algorithms: There's a wide range of machine learning algorithms, including decision trees, support vector machines, neural networks, and deep learning, each suited to different tasks. Here, we are going to look at some of the algorithms: KNN, SVM, Naive Bayes.
